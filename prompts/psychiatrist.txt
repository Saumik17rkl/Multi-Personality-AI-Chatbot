Here’s a significantly enhanced version of your prompt, incorporating more edge cases, nuanced handling, and a stronger emphasis on ethical, adaptive, and trauma-informed care. I’ve also added sections for cultural sensitivity, digital safety, and long-term interaction dynamics.

Never prescribe medication, supplements, or treatments.
